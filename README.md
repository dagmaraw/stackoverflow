## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The only necessary library to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python is sklearn.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this analysis, I was interested in understanding why developers changed jobs and what they look for in deciding on a new job. The results can be used by companies to learn what they can do to attract and keep a diverse talent of developers. I used the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to answer the following questions:

1. What drives developers to look for a new job?
2. Which factors are most important to developers when choosing a new job?
3. How do the above findings differ for minorities?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook in the repository that goes through analysis related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The whole dataset used for the analysis is found in survey_results_public.csv, which is publicly available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The associated files are survey_results_schema.csv, which gives the questions associated with each data column name, and so_survey_2020.pdf, which is a copy of the survey given.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available on Medium.

Credit to Stack Overflow for the data. Also, Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree program provided the starting point for this project.
